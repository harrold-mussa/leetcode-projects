# Data Engineering LeetCode Portfolio

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This collection of solved problems is designed to bridge LeetCode challenges with practical, production-grade **data engineering implementation**. Each solution is treated as a project, demonstrating my proficiency in core Data Engineering principles, including data manipulation, database design, pipeline concepts (**ETL/ELT**), and cloud architecture thinking.

The primary goal of this portfolio is to showcase problem-solving abilities translated into production-ready data practices, specifically utilizing **SQL** and **Python**.

## 1. SQL and Data Fundamentals Mastery

A strong foundation in **SQL** is crucial for any Data Engineer. My solutions focus on writing efficient, optimized, and readable SQL code to solve complex data challenges.

| Concept | Demonstration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced Querying** | Extensive use of `JOIN` types, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to manage logical complexity. |
| **Window Functions** | Implementing `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, and aggregation functions over partitions to solve ranking and sequential data analysis problems. |
| **Database & Schema Design** | For relevant problems, I explain the underlying database **schemas** (e.g., Star, Snowflake) and data modeling choices made, justifying the selection of data types and table relationships. |
| **Optimization** | Focusing on solutions that minimize table scans and maximize execution speed, treating LeetCode constraints as performance requirements. |

## 2. Python for Data Transformation and Analysis

**Python** serves as the backbone for complex transformations and orchestration logic.

* **Core Python:** Leveraging Python's standard library for tasks like complex JSON/XML parsing, robust string manipulation for data cleaning, and efficient file handling (CSV, Parquet).
* **Python Libraries:** I use specialized libraries to simulate real-world data processing environments:
    * **Pandas:** For in-memory data cleaning, complex transformations, feature engineering, and manipulating structured data that mirrors small-scale data pipelines.
    * **PySpark (Conceptual/Future):** Where solutions would benefit from horizontal scaling, I outline the conceptual implementation using PySpark/Spark syntax, demonstrating knowledge of distributed processing paradigms.

## 3. Data Pipelining and Architecture (ETL/ELT)

Every problem in this repository is framed within the context of a Data Pipeline stage.

* **Understanding ETL/ELT:** I differentiate between and demonstrate the application of:
    * **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL):** Where the transformation logic is heavy, often implemented in Python/Pandas before the data is loaded into a final sink.
    * **Extract, Load, Transform (ELT):** Leveraging the power of a modern data warehouse (like BigQuery or Redshift) for transformation logic via complex SQL.
* **Data Quality and Validation:** Solutions incorporate checks (or comments detailing where checks would go) for null values, duplicates, and data type consistency, ensuring data integrity.

## 4. Cloud Platform Relevance (GCP & AWS)

Solutions are documented with notes on how they would be deployed and managed in a major cloud environment, demonstrating operational awareness. This includes conceptual integration with modern orchestration tools (e.g., Apache Airflow, Prefect, or managed cloud services).

* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Context:**
    * **Data Warehousing:** Solutions requiring scalable SQL are conceptualized for **BigQuery**.
    * **Processing:** Python logic would be deployed via **Cloud Functions** or scalable workflows using **Dataflow**.
* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Context:**
    * **Data Warehousing:** SQL solutions are mapped to running on **Amazon Redshift**.
    * **Processing:** Python scripts are imagined running on **AWS Lambda** (serverless) or managed by **AWS Glue** (**ETL** service).

## Repository Structure and Navigation

Projects are organized by primary technology used for the solution:

* `/sql_challenges/`: Contains all pure **SQL** solutions, categorized by difficulty.
* `/python_pandas_etl/`: Contains **Python** solutions leveraging **Pandas** for in-memory transformations.
* `/conceptual_spark/`: Contains Python solutions where **PySpark** implementation is outlined (no execution needed).

By examining the solutions within, you will see not just the answer to a specific problem, but also a demonstration of the Data Engineering thought process required to build robust, scalable, and efficient data systems. Start by exploring the `/sql_challenges/` folder to see advanced querying techniques in action!
